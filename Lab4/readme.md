## Python IDLE
The difference between the shell and the file editor is that the shell is interactive and allows you to run the code to see the outcome immediately and the file editor is where you would establish and edit the code for any necessary bugs in order for smooth execution of the coded program. The shell will also contain the >>> in comparison to the file editor window. 

## Code Examples
### Variable: 
A variable is "kind of like a box that can store a single value", for example, spam = 42 (where spam is the variable and 42 is the value)
Also, the words "spam, eggs, bacon, and ham" are often used in Python tutorials because of the famous spam, eggs, bacon, ham sketch from Monty Python.
### Assignment statement:
A means of storing values from your program to your computer's memory. For example spam = 42 is an assignment statement. 
### Function:
A function is a block of code or a group of related statements that performs a specific task. Example: print("Hello, "name")
### Three data types:
Integers are zero, positive, or negative whole numbers without a fractional & part having unlimited precision. Example: 100, -45, 
Floats are numbers that aren't integers because it includes a fraction that is represented in decimal format. Example: 14.0
Strings are a sequence of characters - the English language has 26 characters...ex. 'A', 'B', 'C' 

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster is the type of image that loses quality when you zoom in or enlarge it, ultimately losing quality of the image. Probably best used for presentations and other applications where enlarging to see detail isn't as necessary. 
Vector images are the opposite of raster and DO allow the ability to enlarge or reduce the image without compromising any quality. An example where this is best used is perhaps an online retailers product images.
