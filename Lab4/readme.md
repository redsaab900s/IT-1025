## Executive Summary 
There are a number of different file formats and methods of compression associated with the varying qualities of files/images. A brief exploration of the topics in the articles that have been read will detail the benefits associated with their uses and how to best achieve the desired quality. 

## Python IDLE
The difference between the shell and the file editor is that the shell is interactive and allows you to run the code to see the outcome immediately and the file editor is where you would establish and edit the code for any necessary bugs in order for smooth execution of the coded program. The shell will also contain the >>> in comparison to the file editor window. 

## Code Examples
### Variable: 
A variable is "kind of like a box that can store a single value", for example, spam = 42 (where spam is the variable and 42 is the value)
Also, the words "spam, eggs, bacon, and ham" are often used in Python tutorials because of the famous spam, eggs, bacon, ham sketch from Monty Python.
### Assignment statement:
A means of storing values from your program to your computer's memory. For example spam = 42 is an assignment statement. 
### Function:
A function is a block of code or a group of related statements that performs a specific task. Example: print("Hello, "name")
### Three data types:
Integers are zero, positive, or negative whole numbers without a fractional & part having unlimited precision. Example: 100, -45, 
Floats are numbers that aren't integers because it includes a fraction that is represented in decimal format. Example: 14.0
Strings are a sequence of characters - the English language has 26 characters...ex. 'A', 'B', 'C' 

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster is the type of image that loses quality when you zoom in or enlarge it, ultimately losing quality of the image. Probably best used for presentations and other applications where enlarging to see detail isn't as necessary. 
Vector images are the opposite of raster and DO allow the ability to enlarge or reduce the image without compromising any quality. An example where this is best used is perhaps an online retailers product images. 
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless image compression means that all of the data from the original file is preserved.
Lossy removes some data from the original file and saves the image with a reduce file size. 
These types of compressions matter to developers because the quality of their work and the images being used are of great importance. Each of the methods in which to save or compress these files have specific applications in order to best preserve their quality. 
### File Formats
GIF - great for animations or line drawings with simple graphics / Not good for images with gradients or photos
JPEG - great for photos or screenshots, especially of movies, games, or similar content / Not good for detailed images or high contrast
PNG - great for line art, illustrations, photos with high contrast, transparency, applications screenshots or detailed diagrams / Not good for low contrast 
### File Properties
The file properties associated with my image are saved as an SVG and the file size is 153,576 bytes.
## Conclusion
Of the many types of file formats that can be used, each has a set of advantages and disadvantages depending on the applications needed for the project that the image will be used for. It is worth understanding the ways in which each of these files can and should be used for the best quality.
