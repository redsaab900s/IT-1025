## Executive Summary 
In this module we have learned again, a bit more about OOP (object oriented programming) in addition to file compression and some of its purposes. Much like we do in science and breaking down the classes of animals, we too, do this in OOP. It helps to assign a pathway to direct or call upon the object. 

## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to effectively reduce a file's size without compromising quality in order to share the file(s). Uses maybe like sharing a song with a friend or uploading a video to a social media platform. 
### Compression and File Size
My image prior to compression was approx. 153,000 kb and was approx. 86,000 once compressed. SVG files, which are text based format, are generally larger because they contain more data. These files use a mathematical structure to represent the image and are highly scalable. Jpeg files, which are in raster format and use lossy compression algorithm, can be reduced to nearly 5% of their original size without losing quality. 

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
In this example of the shark, the attributes are the methods, swim and be awesome.
### Methods:
The methods of the Shark class are 'swim' and 'be awesome'. 
### Constructor:
A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type. Whenever an object is created, the constructor is called automatically.
### Class vs. Object
A class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it. It describes the variables of the object(s) and defines the operations or methods. Object is an element or instance of a class; objects have the behaviors of their class.

## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
To instantiate an object is to create an object.
The instantiated objects of the shark class are, Sammy, Stevie, & Christopher
### Inheritance
Inheritance is essentially the creation of another class from an existing class. An example might be adding types of sharks to the shark class. 
### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Encapsulation relates to the shark class because it has defined variables within its class that are specific to identifying a shark. Abstraction relates to the shark class because the majority of the functions associated with the program are left to be unseen by the user and only the main functions left visible. 

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)

## Conclusion
File compression, especially in regards to images has many benefits, one being the ability to send or share it without losing quality in some cases. Object Oriented Programming is very helpful in creating computer versions of real life objects. The process for creating a simplistic and direct pathway for objects to be called upon seems complex, but is rather rudimentary and makes a lot of sense.
