## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to effectively reduce a file's size without compromising quality in order to share the file(s). Uses maybe like sharing a song with a friend or uploading a video to a social media platform. 
### Compression and File Size
My image prior to compression was approx. 153,000 kb and was approx. 86,000 once compressed. SVG files, which are text based format, are generally larger because they contain more data. These files use a mathematical structure to represent the image and are highly scalable. Jpeg files, which are in raster format and use lossy compression algorithm, can be reduced to nearly 5% of their original size without losing quality.
