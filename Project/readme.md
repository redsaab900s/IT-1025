### Executive Summary


### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan
Originally, I had missed this portion of the assignment and again, my apologies. My original plan was to go the Co-op Readiness route, but since I am a new student and do not have a calculated GPA at this time, I was informed that I couldn't particpate until I had a GPA. With that said, I had to rely on the research paper assigment. For my research paper, I planned to look further into the field and history of AI. I've known of my interest in the field for several years, but hadn't really given myself the time to look further into it. The process was in no way grueling and in rewarding in many ways. 


### Project Part 2:
At first I was a bit apprehensive to explore writing a paper and wanted to take the Co-op Readiness approach.  However, I am glad that I wasn't able to follow through with my initial plans. This project allowed me to reflect on some areas of my life and to perhaps draw some conclusions about things that I otherwise may not have. I particularly enjoyed learning about progression of history in AI that I wasn't privy to before this paper. This project only helped to further solidify my deep interests in this area of computer science, but also reinstilled my fears of not being able to complete my goals due to my struggles with mathematics. I hope I am able to find the courage and not be deterred when it inevitably gets more difficult throughout my journey. 

### Conclusion
Upon registering for this class, I was a little bit frustrated because I was under the impression my previous introduction to computer science class would be credited during my transfer into Tri-c, but it did not. It wasn't long after the first module that I was appreciative  for retaking this, because in many ways I was wrong. It did not cover a lot of what this class encompassed and taught me quite a bit. I found several of the assignments and materials throughout the modules to be incredibly rich in information and fun to learn. The Khan Academy videos about ciphers and cryptology were still some of my favorites. I appreciate all of the encouraged class discussions as well. I haven't been to college since 2009 and was happy to experience this feeling once again, albeit online. Thank you for all of the time you've put into the class and keeping engagement active in such a very condensed time frame.
