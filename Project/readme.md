### Executive Summary


### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan

Describe the process you will take to become co-op ready (include dates of seminars you will plan if you elect Option 1 OR, a brief description of the project you plan to implement (programming, research etc.)

### Project Part 2:
At first I was a bit apprehensive to explore writing a paper and wanted to take the Co-op Readiness approach.  However, I am glad that I wasn't able to follow through with my initial plans. This project allowed me to reflect on some areas of my life and to perhaps draw some conclusions about things that I otherwise may not have. I particularly enjoyed learning about progression of history in AI that I wasn't privy to before this paper. This project only helped to further solidify my deep interests in this area of computer science, but also reinstilled my fears of not being able to complete my goals due to my struggles with mathematics. I hope I am able to find the courage and not be deterred when it inevitably gets more difficult throughout my journey. 

### Conclusion
Upon registering for this class, I was a little bit frustrated because I was under the impression my previous introduction to computer science class would be credited during my transfer into Tri-c, but it did not. It wasn't long after the first module that I was appreciative  for retaking this, because in many ways I was wrong. It did not cover a lot of what this class encompassed and taught me quite a bit. I found several of the assignments and materials throughout the modules to be incredibly rich in information and fun to learn. The Khan Academy videos about ciphers and cryptology were still some of my favorites. I appreciate all of the encouraged class discussions as well. I haven't been to college since 2009 and was happy to experience this feeling once again, albeit online. Thank you for all of the time you've put into the class and keeping engagement active in such a very condensed time frame.
