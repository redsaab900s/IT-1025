## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory

#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is described as the average time it takes the hard drive and its mechanisms to locate the specified sector of disk.
Transfer rates is the speed in which data to and from the disk media.

#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Traditional disk hard drives are a complex set of moving pieces.
Solid state hard drives have no spinning pieces and data is stored in word length pieces allowing almost instantaenous retrieval. 

#### Random Access Memory
Increasing a computers RAM makes a computer operate faster because it is able to hold more readily accessible memory allowing for applications/programs to function with speed and efficiency versus a system that is lacking in RAM and forces the hard drive to be relied on in addition to the RAM because it is not able to store all of the data necessary to effectively run the program. 
A 32 bit data path simply means that 32 bits of data can be transferred in 1 clock cycle. A 62 bit data path means that 64 bits of data can be transferred in 1 clock cycle.

### ALU and the Control Unit
The Control Unit receives the set of instructions from registers that store the addressses and data sent from the RAM. The ALU is instructed by the Control Unit when mathematical computing is needed in order to determine the next step.

### CPU, Input & Output
If pumping gas, the input of payment would be the information received and then sent to the CPU to process and then prompt the user with the choice of fuel as the next set of instructions will determine the output. 

### Logic Gates 
A truth table is a mathematical table used in logic - specifically in connection with Boolean Algebra, boolean functions, and propositional calculus, which sets out the values of logical expressions on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables.
For an AND gate, both input variables must meet the condition to proceed, however, with an OR gate, only one of the input variable must meet the condition to proceed.

### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
The purpose of IEEE is dedicated to advancing innovation and technilogical excellence for the betterment of humanity. It is designed to serve professionals involved in all aspects of electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related to areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization.

## Data Representation

### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal, also known as the Base-10 system, likely the most commonly known number system. Used for counting by early humans. 
Binary, also known as the Base-2 system, is the basis for all modern computing. It's the underlying mathematics and operations that computers perform.
Hexadecimal, also known as the Base-16 system.

### Hexadecimal Color Representation
