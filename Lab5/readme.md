## Lucidchart
I have previously used Lucidchart and like it quite a bit. I had used it to create organizational and operational flowcharts for my last job. I find it rather easy to use and very powerful in how much extra that's imbedded in it. 
## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet:
A unit of data. A message sent between two host computers is broken up into units of data called packets to carry the necessary information. 
#### Packet-Switching:
Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address. This is packet forwarding technology that sends data to its target destination within a LAN (Local Area Network).
#### IP Address:
Unique identifying number. Each device connected to the internet is assigned a means of identification.
#### DNS:
Directory of IP address common names. For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com. When requesting to access a host with a domain, a DNS server is queried and an IP address is returned, allowing for proper routing. 
#### Protocol:
Set of rules to allow devices to communicate. Either TCP/IP or FTP.
