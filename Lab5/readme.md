## Lucidchart
I have previously used Lucidchart and like it quite a bit. I had used it to create organizational and operational flowcharts for my last job. I find it rather easy to use and very powerful in how much extra that's imbedded in it. 
## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet:
A unit of data. A message sent between two host computers is broken up into units of data called packets to carry the necessary information. 
#### Packet-Switching:
Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address. This is packet forwarding technology that sends data to its target destination within a LAN (Local Area Network).
#### IP Address:
Unique identifying number. Each device connected to the internet is assigned a means of identification.
#### DNS:
Directory of IP address common names. For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com. When requesting to access a host with a domain, a DNS server is queried and an IP address is returned, allowing for proper routing. 
#### Protocol:
Set of rules to allow devices to communicate. Either TCP/IP or FTP. 

### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub
The benefit of a switch over a hub is that a hub is not intelligent, unlike a switch, which can route data to specific ports. A hub just resends the data packet on all attached ports. Switches copy the addresses of the connected ports. It also reduces unnecessary traffic. 
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
Hubs and switches are used to create networks while routers are used to connect networks. The router is able to read IP addresses, unlike hubs and switches. 

### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure
A single point of filure is when a central point in a network goes down, thus causing the whole network to go down. Common with star and ring topology networks.
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
The infrastructure newtork still consists of wired elements that allow for a bridge to the network via router. The Wireless mesh topology is able to wirelessly cover a broad area like an office by having many wireless access points. 
### Network Design
I created a network diagram, but I don't believe there is any specific shape to the network topology other than a general sequence of operation in my mind. The modem acts as the gateway to the network that's distributed through the router. I have a PC directly connected to the router. The router is also connected to a wireless access point for the printer and laptop to utilize.
