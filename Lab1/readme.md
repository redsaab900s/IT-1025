## Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 1 is to aquaint the user to the IT1025 course, dive in to the history of computers, and how they have assisted in creating ease of access within our daily lives. IT1025 covers a broad spectrum of computing topics with the intention of helping to hone in on the interests of the user.  IT history is rich in innovative technologies. For example, noting that IBM was a pioneer in so many regards both technologically and socially. Creating insurance policies for employees and leading the way for diversity inclusiveness was incredible to learn! Even if one is not deeply or even slightly interested in the world of IT, frameworks such as GitHub are useful to create, update and maintain any type of file and work in an organized repository. This can be immensely beneficial for projects large and small and can be accessed anywhere in the world so long as permission is granted by the host. 

## Information System Components
- Hardware - Motherboard
- Software - Tableau
- Data - Demographics of a businesses consumers 
- People - Peter Thiel/Elon Musk creating Paypal
- Process - Proof of Stake

## GitHub
GitHub is an example of client - server architecture, as it is a hub for accessing and sharing information to promote collaboration from anywhere in the world, of course, pending certain access and restrictions set by the host.

### Client - Server Architecture 
Client - server architecture, for example in the health care industry, a patient's records could be accessed by multiple care providers pending certain permissions, or a business with many locations could have each locations inventory levels accessed by one or several planners/analysts to forecast or execute decisions.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing acts as a host with many built in features, such as tools, storage, data, management, applications, etc. An example of this would be AWS or Azure

## Conclusion

Thus far, I have reminded myself of the five major components of IS in addition to a nice refresher in the history of computers and the technological advancements that have come from these innovations. While I'm not entirely familiar with Github, I am looking forward to mastering this platform, as it will be paramount in my success moving forwad. Ultimately, I am not the most privy to cloud computing and would certainly like to have a better understanding of and navigating this technology.
