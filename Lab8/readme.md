## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data, is the raw form of facts. It provides details about recorded events. These details can be descriptive in either quantitative or qualitive forms. 
Information is processed data that contains relevance and purpose. 
Knowledge is the information from the processed data that provides the understanding and course to take action. 
Without raw data, information and knowledge cannot exist. Data is used to create and understand trends or behaviors that become information that is used to make knowledgable decisions for a business or individual. 

### Relational Data
#### Primary Key: 
In the example of customers and orders table, the primary key would be a customer ID as well as a transaction ID
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
The relationship would be all activity of that customer. Any order by that customer could be located
#### Foreign key of orders table:
A foreign key in this hypthoetical table would possibly be dates or timestamps, product key, or possibly a payment method
### Field Data Types
It is important to correctly and accurately define the data field because organization of data is crucial in preventing unneccesary redundancies as well as being able to maintain a linking variable throughout the table of data

### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
Volume - the size of the data determines the value that can be extracted from data
Variety - refers to the sources and types and formats of data - structured or unstructured 
Velocity - how fast the data can or is generated
Variablity - refers to the inconsistencies within the data - possible corruptions or redundancies
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Types of technology that are driving the need for big data are social media, many of the readily available online services, personal banking apps, Google maps...etc.
