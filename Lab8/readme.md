## Executive Summary 
In this chapter we learned about relational database management systems and briefly about the SQL that enables us to access and manipulate that data in more direct ways. Additionally, we run through the rules and structures of these two complimentary technologies. We learn about big data, how it is classified and the many ways it is currently in use within our daily lives. Furthermore, we go into detail about the protection and privacy laws regarding the public access and transmission of this data and the many formats that this data can exist as on the internet. 

## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data, is the raw form of facts. It provides details about recorded events. These details can be descriptive in either quantitative or qualitive forms. 
Information is processed data that contains relevance and purpose. 
Knowledge is the information from the processed data that provides the understanding and course to take action. 
Without raw data, information and knowledge cannot exist. Data is used to create and understand trends or behaviors that become information that is used to make knowledgable decisions for a business or individual. 

### Relational Data
#### Primary Key: 
In the example of customers and orders table, the primary key would be a customer ID as well as a transaction ID
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
The relationship would be all activity of that customer. Any order by that customer could be located
#### Foreign key of orders table:
A foreign key in this hypthoetical table would possibly be dates or timestamps, product key, or possibly a payment method
### Field Data Types
It is important to correctly and accurately define the data field because organization of data is crucial in preventing unneccesary redundancies as well as being able to maintain a linking variable throughout the table of data

### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
Volume - the size of the data determines the value that can be extracted from data
Variety - refers to the sources and types and formats of data - structured or unstructured 
Velocity - how fast the data can or is generated
Variablity - refers to the inconsistencies within the data - possible corruptions or redundancies
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Types of technology that are driving the need for big data are social media, many of the readily available online services, personal banking apps, Google maps...etc.

## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
RDBMS stands for relational database management system and is the interface for users when utilizing SQL
SQL stands for search query language and is one of the standard languages used in accessing and manipulating data
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys

## SQL Injections
Similar to my selection of CSV File Injections from the National Vulnerability Database; an SQL injection is a code insertion that can corrupt and/or leach confidential data from a database. It is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
To prevent some of these instances, SQL parameters can be inserted. SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.

## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
The purpose of a code of ethics is to outline a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group; generally, it is agreed to by all members of the group. The document details different actions that are considered appropriate and inappropriate. When approaching new areas of computing, it is necessary to have guidelines to adhere to so that social equity is maintained and respected both presently and moving forward.
### Intellectual Property
If the svg file I made by some miraculous chance was used to represent goods or services, the trademark could protect that image from being replicated or used in some variation elsewhere by either common-law trademark or registered trademark. So long as the owner of the svg file is active in defending the intellectual property, there is no expiration from the protection that is granted from the trademark.
It might be best to seek out copyright as an added layer of protection in the event that another use of the intellectual property appears elsewhere. This will allow the option to take legal action against the lack of permissable use of the copyright material.
### Information Collection
COPPA, which is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), forces websites to comply. Organizations must make a good-faith effort to determine the age of those accessing their websites and, if users are under thirteen years old, must obtain parental consent before collecting any information.
FERPA is a US law that protects the privacy of student education records. In brief, this law specifies that parents have a right to their childâ€™s educational information until the child reaches either the age of eighteen or begins attending school beyond the high school level.
HIPPA is the law the specifically singles out records related to health care as a special class of personally identifiable information. This law gives patients specific rights to control their medical records, requires health care providers and others who maintain this information to get specific permission in order to share it, and imposes penalties on the institutions that breach this trust.

## Conclusion
I really liked this chapter and dealing with SQL. I enjoy Python also, but found the power of SQL to be a bit overlooked previously. Like any language, there are rules to adhere to in order to use it. Just like any tangible asset or innovation, there are ways in which to protect these intellectual properties. Exploring and understanding each of these is crucial in knowing how to protect your intellectual properties from infringements that can surely exist. So too, is the same for data that exists on the web and knowing the ways in which hackers can target your prized credentials to hijack assets and much more.
