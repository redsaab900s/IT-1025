## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
An IP Address is a unique identifying number that is necessary to every device that wishes to connect to the internet. 
IPv4 is an older model of protocol that allows for roughtly 4.3 billion unique IP Addresses. It uses 4 sets of numbers between 0 and 255, separated by periods. 
IPv6 is a new model of protocol that allows for exponentially (340 undecillion) more unique IP Addresses to be generated. It uses the hexadecimal 
#### ICANN
ICANN coordinates the connecting of the many unique IP Addresses that exist within the world of the web so that two devices can communicate. It's objective is to keep the internet secure, stable, and interopable while promoting competition and developing policy on the internets unique identifiers. It also has an important impact on the expansion and evolution of the internet.  

### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
TCP/IP essentially acts as a governance or defined details as to how data can be sent and received through a particular connection point between two or more devices. 
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
The client-server model applies to TCP/IP in a rather simple way. Much like a person (client) seeking to contact another person (server) via phone, the (client) would have to dial that (servers) corresponding number to initiate the potential connection. The (server) must decide to accept or reject that initiated connection. If accepted, there is a secured port or network between the two points in which they can communicate and share data. 
#### Layers
The reason layers are important to changing technology is for seemingly obvious reasons related to eing able to have software that can adap to ethe evolving needs of a network and its protocols without affecting the other layers of the network and its functions. 
#### Application Layer
The applications that use the applications layer are HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, SMTP among many others...

## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for sharing data over the web. It is similar to a client server model because it is a command and response text based protocol. The client makes a request and the server responds or rejects. 
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
HTTPS encrypts the data being retrieved by HTTP. This is done by using encryption algorithms to scramble the data that's being transferred.
SSL (Secure Socket Layer) uses a certificate to authenticate the client-server before allowing any other data exchange to take place between the connected devices.
TLS (Transport Layer Security) also uses certificates to authenticate the client-server and is the latest cryptographic protocol.

## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
One of the main reasons to secure your browser, is because the default web browsers that are installed on most devices do not come standard with a high level of security to prevent any detriment to your computer or the information exchanged while on the web. 
### Risk Explained
A major risk in failing to implement any of these measures could result in valuable information being leaked. For example, while inputing your credit card information, address, telephone number, birthday,...etc on an usecured webpage and a minimally or unsecure web browser could lead to that information being submitted not only to the vendor, but also any potential hacker that may be targeting your information. 

## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web. He created the W3C to help coordinate technology development and manage the operations of the Consortium.
Browsers and authoring tools are important in the continual advancement of allowing for not only access, but also the ability to create and publish content that is universally visible to any device that aligns with the necessary protocols for connecting to the internet.
