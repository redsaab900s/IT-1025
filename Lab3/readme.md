## Executive Summary 
There are many different softwares that exist and each have their own respective purposes. In this lesson we break down the operating system, applications, and utilities to understand the impacts on the computer and within our lives, both good and bad. We learn about the evolution of events that lead to the development of these technologies and how they now benefit us personally and professionally. 

## Software
### Types of Software
Applications - are software designed with the idea in mind to execute certain functions, achieve specific goals, or provide the user with a particular experience. Some examples of this would be MS Word or the famous, Instagram. 
Utilities - are software that allow the user to fix or modify the computer. Some examples are anti-virus or a VPN.
Operating Systems - are the other half of the guts to a computer. The instruction generating components that allow the user to interface with the computer and its applications and/or utilities. Without this, none of these software can exist.

### ERP
An ERP system is a comprehensive business strategy, inventory management, supply chain management system,...etc. among many other features that enables an organization to operate from one dashboard rather than many splintered sources of information. 

## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
A common IT problem that was resolved from virtualization was the ability to partition a server's capacity to allow for maximum efficiency therefore reducing many associated expenses with the older way of running computer operations and ultimately became the foundations of cloud computing.

### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisors were developed decades ago to give multiple users simultaneous access to computers that performed batch processing, a popular computing style in the business world. An example of this would be payroll. Simply put, hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments. 

## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Pseudo-Code is essentially a simplified version of programming without the strictness of a formal programming language. 

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, the interpreter, reads and executes the code. 

## Career Exploration
### Handshake
I had did a bit of exploring with Handshake not long after enrolling and found that there are quite a bit of job opportunities as well as some internships for varying levels of experience for the IT field. Once I have more experience to show for my skills, I'll seek out a hopeful internship or workstudy program. Ideally, something with NASA, Heureka, RazorEdge or Workhorse, would be of interest. 

### Bureau of Labor Statistics
I really enjoy this kind of data. It's interesting to see the projected decline of so many jobs that require little to no credentials to hold the positions. Also interesting is that it appears "embalmers" have some relative job security. 

### Certifications
Admittedly, I do not find much interest in cybersecurity for my future, although, I do expect that there are benefits to understanding some core principles of cybersecurity and mitigating any potential threats. The CompTIA Project+ certification would be a great supplement for project management skills and the like. 

### Certificates and Degrees
I'm actually interested in both the Blockchain and Data Analytics Post Degree Cert. I have a number of years of experience in supply chain and manufacturing to which I feel Blockchain technology will eventually and drastically improve so much of the issues within. In regards to the data analytics program, I feel it will only further instill my understandings of how to effectively work with data. 

### Co-ops / Internships
The steps to becoming Co-op ready are meeting the Eligibility Requirements:

Currently enrolled at Cuyahoga Community College
Completed 12 credit hours of college coursework (includes transfer credits) with at least two courses related to your major field
GPA of 2.75 or higher

Student Expectations:

Complete the Application of Interest
Participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center
Upload your resume for final revisions and approval by a Career Coach at Handshake
Complete and sign a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form

The benefits of pursuing these options will provide a more thorough understanding of application regarding the in class curriculum as it applies in realistic scenarios that an employer is likely seeking. 

### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
I actually submitted my interests via survey through Tri-c about the clubs I am interested in trying to fit into my immensely packed schedule. I included IT Club, Psychology Club, ITCAC, Engineering Technology Club, as well as Physics & Astronomy Club. I'd really like to be immersed in a group of like minds and pursuing similar or different fields. I find it incredibly beneficial to me, as motivation can become stagnant when primarily in ones own company for extended periods. The ACM-W is a supportive and advocacy group for women in the computing industry. I wholeheartedly support this and think it would be beneficial to be a part of a long overdue change of societal opinions and the embracing of gender acceptance in all roles, especially in the technical industries such as IT. I'm also quite impressed that the Tri-c team was able to progres to the regional level in 2017!

## Conclusion
Software is Great! It has enabled us to do things such as take online classes, as to accomodate our busy lifestyles. It has also enabled us to almost effortlessly improve and supervise an organizations entire operations. Without software and in its many forms, we wouldn't have much use for the hardware components. Overall, software as allowed for us in some ways, to simplify our lives of the monotonous tasks so that we are able to focus our problem solving skills elsewhere.
