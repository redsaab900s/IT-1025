## Software
### Types of Software
Applications - are software designed with the idea in mind to execute certain functions, achieve specific goals, or provide the user with a particular experience. Some examples of this would be MS Word or the famous, Instagram. 
Utilities - are software that allow the user to fix or modify the computer. Some examples are anti-virus or a VPN.
Operating Systems - are the other half of the guts to a computer. The instruction generating components that allow the user to interface with the computer and its applications and/or utilities. Without this, none of these software can exist.

### ERP
An ERP system is a comprehensive business strategy, inventory management, supply chain management system,...etc. among many other features that enables an organization to operate from one dashboard rather than many splintered sources of information. 

## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
A common IT problem that was resolved from virtualization was the ability to partition a server's capacity to allow for maximum efficiency therefore reducing many associated expenses with the older way of running computer operations and ultimately became the foundations of cloud computing.

### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisors were developed decades ago to give multiple users simultaneous access to computers that performed batch processing, a popular computing style in the business world. An example of this would be payroll. Simply put, hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments. 

## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Pseudo-Code is essentially a simplified version of programming without the strictness of a formal programming language. 

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, the interpreter, reads and executes the code.
